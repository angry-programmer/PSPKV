		<explain>Rank ordering of defects should be used to guide corrective action is the underlying
principle behind Pareto diagrams. Pareto diagrams are based on the 80/20 principle,
which states that 80 percent of the problems are due to 20 percent of the causes. These
charts represent the information in order of priority and help focus attention on the most
critical issues. It prioritizes potential causes of the problem.
Inspection is a technique used in Perform Quality Control. It includes activities such as
examining, measuring, and testing to determine whether results conform to
requirements.
Trend analysis is a technique that examines project results over time to determine if
performance is improving or degrading.

		</answers>
		<explain>The next action you should take is to refer to the WBS, and then either accept or deny
the claim of the business analyst. The detailed project scope statement, WBS, and WBS
dictionary must be a full and final basis for scope verification and resolution of any
disputes with respect to the project's scope. The deliverables and activities, which are not
a part of WBS, are not in scope.
You should not refer to the scope management plan, and then either accept or deny
the claim of the business analyst. The scope management plan is a document that
outlines how the scope will be monitored and managed throughout the project. While it
does serve as input to Scope Verification, it alone should not be used to verify completion
of work. The detailed scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary contain more detailed
information about each individual deliverable. These serve as the scope baseline and
should be used to verify completion of work.
You should not refer to the project charter or minutes of the meetings. The project
charter or minutes of meeting cannot be and must not be treated as the basis for project
scope. The detailed project scope statement, reviewed or signed WBS, and WBS
dictionary is the final basis.</explain>

		<explain>Project Risk Monitoring and Control does not include decision tree analysis. The
decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the
implications of choosing the same. It factors in the probability of events and their
potential impact when arriving at the best course of action in a given situation. It is a tool
used in Quantitative Risk Analysis.
A project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a
negative effect on a project objective. Project risk reviews check the risks to a project
when the implementation of the project begins. It is one of the tools used in Risk
Monitoring and Control.
While implementing the risk controls during the project operation, many risks may or
may not occur. The risk response plan is updated as an output of the Risk Monitoring and
Control.
Implementation of risk responses is part of the Risk Monitoring and Control process.
During Risk Response Planning, all identified risks are listed, and a strategy to counter
those risks is formulated. The Risk Monitoring and Control process implements these risk
responses as planned.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">it is the key factor for team development</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">it is not critical for the success of the project</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">it is the responsibility of the functional manager</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">it is generally the responsibility of the project manager</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Regarding effective management of a dual reporting relationship, this statement is
true: it is generally the responsibility of the project manager.
A dual reporting relationship is where an individual reports to more than one superior.
This occurs in a matrix organization where an individual reports to both a functional
manager and a project manager. Effective team management is usually be more difficult
when a dual reporting relationship exists because there can be conflict between the two
managers to which the individual reports. According to the PMBOK, it is usually the
project manager's responsibility to ensure that this dual reporting relationship is
managed effectively.
While effectively managing the dual reporting relationship is important in Manage
Project Team, it is not the key factor because not all organizations will be faced with this
issue. In functional or projectized organizations, individuals report to a single manager.
According to the PMBOK, effective management of a dual reporting relationship is
critical to the success of a project.
According to the PMBOK, it is usually the project manager's responsibility to ensure
that this dual reporting relationship is managed effectively.</explain>

		<text>You are managing a project that was originally scheduled to take 12 months to complete.
The original budget was $486,000, or $40,500 each month. At the end of month, you are
evaluating progress. You have completed 40 percent of the work and have $90,000
remaining in your budget. What is your ETC (Estimate To Complete)?</text>

			<answer is_right="false">$396,000</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">$595,836.73</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">$991,836.73</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Your Estimate to Complete (ETC) is $595,836.73. ETC represents the estimated costs of
completing the remaining work. To arrive at the ETC, you perform these calculations:
BAC = $486,000
AC = $486,000 - $90,000 = $396,000
EV = BAC x percent complete = $486,000 x .40 = $194,400
CPI = EV / AC = $194,400 / $396,000 = 0.49
EAC = BAC / CPI = $486,000 / 0.49 = $991836.73
Then, you can use this formula to calculate the ETC:
ETC = EAC - AC = $991,836.73 - $396,000 = $595,836.73
All of the other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the correct ETC value.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">Contract Closure</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">Contract Administration</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>A payment system is a part of Contract Administration. The Contract Administration
process verifies and ensures that the seller is on track for the contract delivery. It involves
coordination between the seller and buyer teams. A payment system is one of the tools
used in Contract Administration for the disbursement of money to the subcontractor.
A payment system is not a part of Request Seller Responses. The Request Seller
Responses process involves contacting probable sellers and obtaining proposals from
them on how they can meet the requirements of the buyer. Proposals are documents
prepared by the sellers to describe how they can service the requirements of the buyer.
A payment system is not a part of Select Sellers. The Select Sellers process deals with
deciding on the seller for the contract. It involves negotiation and selection.
A payment system is not a part of Contract Closure. Contract Closure is a process
where the buyer and seller decide to close the contract after the work per the contract is
completed or the contract needs to be terminated for some other reason. This includes all
contract related documentation, procurement audits, etc.</explain>

		<text>Which of the following can you calculate if you know the values for Budgeted Cost of
Work Performed and Schedule Performance Index?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="true">SV – Shedule Variance</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">CPI – Cost Performance Index</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">EAC – Estimate At Completion</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">ROI – Return Of Investment</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>If you know the values for Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and Schedule
Performance Index (SPI) for your project, you can calculate Schedule Variance (SV).
Variance analysis is an effective tool to monitor and control project schedules. SPI is equal
to BCWP divided by Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS). SV is equal to BCWP BCWS. Given the values of SPI and BCWP, you can calculate the value of BCWS, and
consequently SV.
Given these values, you can also calculate the Percentage of Work Complete. The
Percentage of Work Complete is calculated as BCWP/BCWS x 100, or SPI x 100.
Given the values of BCWP and SPI, you would not be able to calculate the CPI. The CPI
is calculated by dividing Earned Value (EV) by Actual Cost (AC). EV is also known as BCWP,
and AC is also known as Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).
Given the values of BCWP and SPI, you would not be able to calculate the Return on
Investment (ROI). The ROI is a percentage indicating the return on an investment.</explain>

		<text>You changed the scope of your project because of a change in client-side quality
procedures and norms. The project plan document and acceptance criteria were updated
accordingly. What should be your next step?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">prepare a version change report</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">notify stakeholders as appropriate</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">revise the company's quality management manual</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">obtain formal acceptance from your sponsor and customer</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Your next step should be to notify stakeholders as appropriate. Scope changes might
require modifications to cost, time, quality, or other project objectives. After you update
the project plan document and acceptance criteria, you should notify stakeholders.
Your next step should not be to prepare a version change report. You should inform the
stakeholders about the updated documents before preparing version change reports.
Your next step should not be to revise the company's quality management manual. A
change in the client-side quality procedures and norms does not require a change in your
company's quality management manual. These norms might cause some changes to the
procedures you follow in this specific project, but would not affect the overall quality
management system of your organization.
Your next step should not be to obtain formal acceptance from your sponsor and
customer. Obtaining formal acceptance from the sponsor or client happens before
updating the project plan and acceptance criteria.</explain>

		<text>You are the project manager for a Spring Field Ski Resort construction project, which is
progressing as per the schedule. During the regular monthly project status meeting with
the client, the senior management formally informed you that they want to stop the
project work for an indefinite period of time due to insufficient funds. You returned from
the meeting and asked your team to submit the report of tasks completed to date and
requested a copy of the contract from your legal department. Which BEST describes this
situation?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">you have initiated Project Closure activities</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">you have initiated Contract Closure activities</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">you have initiated Performance Reporting activities</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">you have initiated Scope Verification activities to establish the completion status</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>The statement that best describes the situation is: you have initiated Scope
Verification activities to establish the completion status.
Scope Verification activities are necessary when the required deliverables are ready and
the project is coming to a logical end or when the project is being terminated ahead of
schedule. In this scenario, the client has requested that project work stop for an indefinite
time period. This does not indicate that the project should be closed. You must refer to
the contract to identify the provisions for this type of situation.
You have not initiated Project Closure activities. Project Closure is not a valid
process.
You have not initiated Contract Closure activities. Contract Closure activities are
initiated when closing the contract with a contractor or vendor, and not during project
closure.
You have not initiated Performance Reporting activities. Performance Reporting
activities occur before Scope Verification. You should first obtain information on tasks and
activities completed to date and only then proceed with Scope Verification activities.</explain>

			<answer is_right="true">$8,000 and $10,000</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">$10,000 and $8,000</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">the values cannot be calculated from available data</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>The values for EV and PV are $8,000 and $10,000, respectively. Variance analysis is an
effective tool to monitor and control project schedules. Schedule Variance (SV) is equal to
Earned Value (EV) less Planned Value (PV), or EV - PV. Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is
equal to EV divided by PV. In this scenario, the following equations can be solved
simultaneously:
equation 1 EV - PV = -2000 ,
equation 2 EV / PV = 0.8 .
From the first equation, we can imply that EV = PV -2000.
Substituting this value of EV in the second equation, we can solve as below:
(PV - 2000)/PV = 0.8
or PV - 2000 = 0.8 PV ,
or 0.2 PV = 2000 ,
or PV = 10000 .
Therefore, EV = 8000.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">Integrated Change Control</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">Schedule Development</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">Cost Control</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>The Schedule Development process does not use the outputs of the Performance
Reporting process as inputs. Schedule Development involves creating the project
schedule, before starting work on the project. Performance Reporting involves reporting
of progress on work performed on the project and how the project is proceeding, this
would occur after work had begun. Several monitoring and controlling processes use
Performance Reporting outputs as input.
The Contract Administration process uses performance reports as an input.
Reviewing project performance is important in managing the contract throughout the
project.
The Integrated Change Control process uses the requested changes and
recommended corrective actions resulting from Performance Reporting as input. These
changes are then either approved or rejected.
The Cost Control process uses performance reports as an input. Reports indicating
how the project is performing with regard to the budget are important in managing and
controlling the costs for the project.</explain>

		<text>Your current project can be summarized as:
the EV is 750,000; the AC is 600,000; the PV is 500,000.
// EV – Earned Value, AC – Actual Cost, PV – Planned Value
What is your project's SPI (Schedule Performance Index)?
</text>

			<answer is_right="false">-3.0</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">-1.5</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">1.5</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">3.0</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Your project's SPI is 1.5. The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) can be calculated using
this formula: SPI = EV / PV .
In this scenario, the SPI would be calculated as 750,000 / 500,000, or 1.5. This means your
project is proceeding at approximately 150 percent of the rate you originally planned. SPI
is a key indicator of project schedule performance. If SPI is greater than one, it indicates
that the project is ahead of schedule, and if SPI is less than one then the project is slipping
behind schedule. In this scenario, the SPI indicates that the project is slipping behind
schedule.
All of the other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the correct SPI value.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">project management plan</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">project activity attributes</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">scope management plan</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>You need to compare the requests to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). You will
refer to the WBS because it identifies the scope of the project. Any modification to the
approved WBS results in a scope change. To assess the degree of the scope change, the
change request is compared to a scope baseline. The scope baseline of a project is
defined by the detailed project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.
You do not need to compare the requests to the project management plan. A project
management plan helps manage project execution. You refer to the project management
plan to assess the impact of the scope change on other areas of the project.
You do not need to compare the requests to the project activity attributes. Activity
attributes are characteristics of each of the scheduled project activities in the activity list.
These attributes, such as the activity identifier, codes, activity description, logical
relationships, and resources assigned, are used when developing the schedule.
You do not need to compare the requests to the scope management plan. A scope
management plan defines processes to manage scope changes. It cannot identify the
scope change itself.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>The probability that random variations would result in seven or more consecutive
results to be found on the same side of the mean is 1.56%. This is based on the Rule of
Seven and indicates that the variation is due to an assignable cause and must be
investigated.
All of the other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the correct probability
that random causes would have caused this.
The Rule of Seven explains that the probability of seven consecutive results being on
the same side of the mean is (1/2) raised to the power of 7. This equals 1.56%. Up to six
consecutive variations on the same side could be attributable to random causes, but
seven or more indicates that the probability of this being due to random causes is very

		<explain>You should first prepare a change request. To incorporate a change, the change control
board must approve the change. Preparing a change request starts the process of calling a
meeting and seeking approval. After the change request is approved or rejected, all
stakeholders should be informed.
You should not meet with top management to discuss the matter. Before meeting with
top management, you should create a change request. This will serve as the agenda of
the meeting with top management. After a change request is prepared, a meeting of the
change control board can be called.
You should not change the WBS, project schedule, and the project plan to reflect the
new requirement. To change the WBS, project schedule, and the project plan to reflect
the new requirement, these have to be approved by all stakeholders. A change request
has to be prepared followed by a meeting of the change control board to seek approval of
the changes. When the change control board approves the change, you can update the
WBS, project schedule, and project plan to reflect the new requirement.

output of the Create WBS process and defines the detail scope of the project using a
structured list of project deliverables. Schedule Control refers to the process of
controlling the factors that affect the project schedule to ensure that such changes are
agreed upon. It is also concerned with identifying and managing such changes as they
occur in the project.
Approved change requests are an input to the Schedule Control process. Change
requests may occur from time to time during the project and could be oral or written.
Such requests could originate internally or due to external factors and could widen or
narrow the scope of the project.
The schedule baseline, also known as the project schedule, is an input to the Schedule
Control process. It shows the planned start and finish dates for each activity in the
project.
Performance reports are an input to the Schedule Control process. These reports

		<explain>A Pareto diagram helps the project team to focus on the most significant problems. A
Pareto diagram is a bar chart based on the Pareto 80/20 law, which states that 80 percent
of problems stem from 20 percent of the causes. It shows problems ranked in descending
order of significance. It helps the project team to identify and focus on the most
significant problems.
To forecast future problems, you could use a scatter diagram, which is a tool for trend
analysis. This diagram plots data on an X/Y axis to identify correlation between them. It
helps in forecasting future trends.
To analyze causes of problems, you could use a fishbone, or Ishikawa, diagram. This is a
cause-effect diagram and helps in identifying the root causes of a quality problem by
showing how various factors are linked to potential problems.
To display if the process is in control, you could use a control chart, which is a graphic
display of process results shown over a period of time to help determine if the process is
in control. It shows if differences in results are due to random causes or unusual events
that need to be identified and rectified.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>Integrated Change Control does not involve establishing a cost baseline for measuring
project performance. The cost baseline for measuring project performance is established
as a part of Cost Budgeting. This activity is performed under Project Cost Management.
Integrated Change Control is a part of Project Integration Management.
Under Integrated Change Control, the project scope is maintained, either by rejecting
the changes or by accepting and incorporating the changes into the revised project
baseline.
Incorporating the changes into a revised project baseline is an essential activity under
Integrated Change Control. Project management plan updates are the output of this
activity.
The integrity of the performance measurement baseline is maintained under
Integrated Change Control by continuously managing changes to the baseline by either
rejecting the changes or approving the changes and incorporating them into the revised
project baseline.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">performance appraisals should include only positive feedback</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">performance appraisals can be used to convey a redefinition of the team member's
roles and responsibilities</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Performance appraisals can be used to convey a redefinition of the team member's
roles and responsibilities. Performance appraisals are conducted throughout the
execution of a project as part of managing the project team. Performance appraisals
provide team members with feedback on their performance, but can also be used in
identifying new issues, convey a redefinition of roles and responsibilities, and establish
training plans and goals for team members.
Feedback for the review should be solicited from many sources, including individuals in
supervisory roles, colleagues, and subordinates. This concept is referred to as "360degree feedback".
Performance appraisals can be informal and unwritten. However, for larger complex
projects, they are usually in a written form. Organizational policies often dictate whether
performance appraisals must be officially documented.
Performance appraisals should include both positive and negative feedback. They
should provide accurate assessment of the team member's performance, even if this is
not positive.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>Your immediate next step should be to rebaseline the schedule. After a revision to the
schedule is issued and approved, you should rebaseline the schedule and inform
appropriate stakeholders of this new baseline.
A project schedule serves as a schedule baseline and helps measure project schedule
performance. This is the only schedule that is followed throughout the project. In case of
revisions, the project schedule is rebaselined on agreement of all the stakeholders. A new
schedule is not prepared.
A change request is initiated when the project manager seeks approval on a revision to
the project schedule.
Performance reports provide information on schedule performance. These are used to
determine if there is a schedule variance.</explain>

		<text>Rather than use a WBS as you suggested, your team developed an SOW to define the
project's work components. The client reviewed this document, uncovered that a scope
change was needed, and a change request was subsequently written. This is an example
of a change request that was the result of:
// SOW – Statement Of Work</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">an external event</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">a value-adding change</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">an error in defining the product scope</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">an error in defining the project scope</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>This is an example of a change request that was the result of an error in defining the
project scope. A statement of work (SOW) is a narrative description of products or
services to be supplied under contract, whereas the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a
deliverable-oriented grouping of project components used to define the total scope of
the project. Using an SOW instead of a WBS may result in a poorly defined scope and
subsequent change request. Therefore, the change request in this scenario is due to an
error in defining the project scope.
This is not an example of a change request that was the result of external events.
External events are events outside the project, such as a change in the government
regulation. While these can also cause a change request, this was not the case in this
scenario.
This is not an example of a change request that was the result of a value-adding
change. A value-adding change can cause a change request only when a change in the
technology, which was non-existent at the time of defining the scope of the project, is
adopted for project execution to reduce project cost or project time.
This is not an example of a change request that was the result of an error in defining
the product scope. An error in defining the product scope will result in a change request
only in case of failure to include a required product feature while defining product scope.
WBS is a deliverable-oriented grouping of project components used to define the total
scope of the project. If an SOW is prepared in place of a WBS, it will result in improper
definition of the project scope, not the product scope.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>Next, you should give a performance report. Performance reporting provides details on
the subcontractor regarding various parameters like, schedule, quality, etc. Because in
this case there is no mention of the invoices that have been submitted, you can give a
performance report stating the delay and the reference to the contract. When the seller
submits the invoices, then based on this report his payment will be adjusted accordingly.
You should not submit a change request. Submitting a change request is out of context
here. A change request would be submitted if the scope outlined in the contract needed
to be modified.
You should not generate a payment request. A payment request does not arise until
the seller has submitted the invoices.
You should not inform the seller of the default. The seller will be aware about the delay

Avoidance, or withdrawal, involves retreating or postponing the decision on a problem.
This is normally never a good choice for conflict resolution.
Confronting deals with solving the real problem. The people involved can best diffuse
the problem or the situation. This conflict resolution technique is more of a democratic
approach where both parties deliberate and arrive at a solution.
Compromising deals with arriving at solution that requires both the parties to give up

			<answer is_right="false">Actual Cost of Work Performed</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">Actual Cost of Work Scheduled</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Earned Value Analysis does not require the value of Actual Cost of Work Scheduled
(ACWS). Earned Value Analysis is the most common tool used for Performance Reporting.
It measures project performance by calculating powerful indicators including Cost
Variance (CV), Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Performance Index (CPI), and Schedule
Performance Index (SPI). To compute these indicators, you need to know the values for
Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP), also known as Earned Value (EV), Actual Cost
of Work Performed (ACWP), also known as Actual Cost (AC), and Budgeted Cost of Work
Scheduled (BCWS), also known as Planned Value (PV).
The following formulas are used to calculate CV and SV:
CV = EV – AC ,
SV = EV – PV .
If CV&gt;0, the project is under budget, and if CV&lt;0, the project is overspent. If SV&gt;0, the
project is ahead of schedule, and if SV&lt;0, the project is behind schedule.
The following formulas are used to calculate CPI and SPI:
CPI = EV / AC ,
SPI = EV / PV .
If CPI&gt;1, it indicates that the project team has spent more than planned, and vice versa if
CPI&lt;1. If SPI&gt;1, it indicates that the project team is ahead of schedule, and vice versa if
SPI&lt;1.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>Standards and regulations are an enterprise environmental factor used as an input to
Quality Planning, and not to Perform Quality Control. Standards and regulations are also
used as input in other initiating and planning processes. A standard is a document
approved by a recognized body that provides rules, guidelines, or characteristics for
products, processes or services with which compliance is not mandatory. A regulation is a
document that specifies product, process, or service characteristics with which it is
mandatory to comply. The project team must consider any application area specific
standard regulation that may affect the project. Inputs to Perform Quality Control include
the quality management plan, quality metrics, quality checklists, organizational process
assets, work performance information, approved change requests, and deliverables.
Deliverables are outputs of activities performed to accomplish the project. It includes
both process results and product results, and is an input to Perform Quality Control.
The quality management plan describes how the project management team will
implement its quality policy. It is an input to Perform Quality Control.
Quality metrics, when applied to data collection, are a clear, concise detailed definition
of a measure. The need for quality metrics is fundamental when collecting all types of
data. It is particularly important when a decision is being made about whether or not
something is correct, or when a visual check is being made where there is a possibility for
confusion. Quality metrics are an input to Perform Quality Control.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">the Early Start of succeeding Activity B is delayed by three days, and the project
finish date is delayed by three days</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>In this scenario, the Early Start of succeeding Activity B is delayed by three days, and
the project finish date is not affected. Because the free float (FF) for Activity A is 12 days,
a delay of 15 days in its Early Start will cause the succeeding Activity B to be delayed by
three days. FF refers to the amount of time that you can delay an activity on a project
without affecting the Early Start date of a succeeding activity. Total float (TF) refers to the
amount of time that you can delay an activity on a project without affecting the finish
date of the project. Because the TF for Activity A is 15 days, a delay of 15 days in its Early
Start will not affect the project finish date.

			<answer is_right="true">CV is negative and SV is positive</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>If an organization has spent money on a project to crash the project schedule, the Cost
Variance (CV) is negative and Schedule Variance (SV) is positive. According to Earned
Value Management theory, CV is the difference between Earned Value (EV) and Actual
Cost (AC). SV is the difference between EV and Planned Value (PV). If CV is positive, the
project is under budget, and if CV is negative, the project is overspent. If SV is positive,
the project is ahead of schedule, and if SV is negative, the project is behind schedule.
If CV is negative, but SV is positive, the project is ahead of schedule but more has been
spent on the project than planned. This usually happens when the organization spends
money to crash the project schedule and try to finish some tasks ahead of the planned
schedule.
If CV is positive and SV is negative, the project is behind schedule and it is likely that
not enough resources have been applied.
If both CV and SV are positive, the project is under budget and ahead of schedule. This
is the perfect situation for any project.
If both CV and SV are negative, the project is overspent and behind schedule. This is
the worst situation for any project.</explain>

		<explain>In the Performance Reporting process, a time reporting system would be used to
collect and document the time spent on executing work required to produce project
deliverables. A time reporting system usually includes a means of allowing team members
to record information about the time spent on project activities. Team members typically
enter the hours worked on specific activities. This information can be used in
performance reporting and progress reporting.
The hourly wages of team members is documented in the payroll system. You might
choose to use this wage information along with hours worked when reporting cost status
of a project.
The early start and late start of project activities is defined and documented when
scheduling a project.
Forecasted completion dates for a project are created during the Monitor and Control
Project Work process. These forecasted completion dates can then be used as an input to
Performance Reporting.</explain>

		<text>At the end of six months of a project, you find that the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed
is $40,000, the Actual Cost of Work Performed is $45,000, and the Budgeted Cost of Work
Scheduled is $38,000. Which of the following statements is true?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">the project is behind schedule and over budget</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">the project is behind schedule and under budget</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">the project is ahead of schedule and over budget</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">the project is ahead of schedule and under budget</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>The project is ahead of schedule and over budget. The project is ahead of schedule
because the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is greater than the Budgeted Cost
of Work Scheduled (BCWS). A Schedule Performance Index (SPI) of greater than one also
indicates the status of the schedule. SPI equals BCWP divided by the BCWS. In the given
scenario, the SPI is equal to 40000/38000, or 1.05. This project is over budget because the
Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) is greater than the BCWP. Cost Performance
Index (CPI) of less than one indicates the project is over budget. CPI equals BCWP divided
by the ACWP. In the given scenario, the CPI is equal 40000/45000, or 0.89.
The project is behind schedule and under budget if SPI was less than one and CPI is
greater than one.
The project is behind schedule and over budget if both SPI and CPI are less than one.
The project is ahead of schedule and under budget if both SPI and CPI are greater than
one.</explain>

			<answer is_right="true">perform a trend analysis</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>To monitor the number of errors or defects that have been identified and the number
of errors or defects that are uncorrected, you should perform a trend analysis. Trend
analysis helps monitor the number of errors identified and the number of errors that
remain uncorrected. This analysis also helps monitor how many activities in a given
period were completed with significant variances.
You should not use a checklist. A checklist is a tool that verifies that a set of required
steps have been performed. It does not help to monitor the number of errors or defects
that have been identified and the number that remains undetected. Checklists are an
input to Perform Quality Control.
You should not perform an audit. An audit reviews all the quality management
activities. The objective of a quality audit is to identify lessons learned that could help
improve performance of the project or of other projects within the performing
organization. Auditing is a tool used in Perform Quality Assurance.
You should not design an experiment. Design of experiments is a statistical method
that helps identify which factors might influence specific variables. Design of experiments
is a tool used in Quality Planning.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">failure to include a required feature in the design of a telecommunication system</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Discovering a need to engage in bottom-up estimating is not an example of a source of
scope change. Scope changes might occur due to an external event, an error in defining
the scope of the project or the product, a value adding change, or because of
implementing a contingency plan or workaround plan to respond to a risk.
Variation in government regulations is an external event, which can be a source of
scope change.
Introducing technology that was not available when the scope was originally defined
will result in a scope change and must therefore be considered as a source of scope
change.
Failure to include a required feature in the design of a telecommunication system can
be classified as an error in defining the scope of the product and is therefore a valid
source of scope change.</explain>

		<explain>During the Schedule Control process, a progress report would not contain a prediction
or forecast for unfinished work. Progress reports are intended to be factual and statistical
as opposed to hypothetical or predictive. They show the amount of work completed in
relation to the planned estimates.
Progress reports typically contain the actual start date, the actual finish date, any
percent-completed statistics, and the amount of time remaining for unfinished work. All
of this data should be based on factual information. The nature of progress reports can
vary by project. Some projects may require detailed progress reports to be submitted on
a regularly scheduled basis. Typically, progress reports are sent to the project sponsors
and stakeholders as indicated in the project management plan.</explain>

		<explain>The Variance at Completion (VAC) in percentage for your project will be -20%. If you
find that original project estimation assumptions are fundamentally flawed, your Estimate
at Completion (EAC) would be the sum of Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) to date
and the new Estimate to Complete (ETC). In the given scenario:
EAC = ACWP + ETC = $34,000 + $38,000 = $72,000
VAC = BAC - EAC = $60,000 - $72,000 = - $12,000
VAC % = VAC / BAC x 100 = -$12,000/$60,000 x 100 = -20%

			<answer is_right="true">the information is insufficient to make an assessment</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>An Earned Value Management (EVM) analysis must be performed to know if the
project will finish within the original budget. To perform an EVM analysis, in addition to
what was budgeted and what was spent, you need information on how much work was
accomplished. This information is absent in this scenario so there is insufficient
information to make an assessment.
To know if the project is ahead of schedule, you need to know the schedule variance.
To find the schedule variance you need information on what work was planned and how
much of it was accomplished. This information is absent in this scenario. Therefore, it is
not possible to assess whether the project is ahead of schedule.
To know if the project is in trouble because of the cost overrun, you need to know the
cost variance on the project. To find the cost variance, in addition to what was budgeted
and what was spent you need information on how much work was accomplished by
incurring the stated expense.
It is not possible to state that the project will finish within the original budget using the

		</answers>
		<explain>A buyer-conducted performance review is not an output of Contract Administration. A
buyer-conducted performance review is a formal or informal review by the buyer of how
well the seller is performing on the contract. Buyer-conducted performance reviews are a
tool used in Contract Administration. Buyer-conducted performance reviews are
conducted in the Contract Administration process to determine if the seller is fulfilling the
contract statement of work.
All of the other options are incorrect because they are outputs of Contract
Administration.
Correspondence is one of the organizational process asset updates that are an output of
Contract Administration.
Correspondence includes all communication related to various contract-related issues
between the seller and the buyer, including communication on project deliveries,
changes, status updates, and results of inspections and audits, Most of the time, these
communications are written communication.
Requested unapproved contract changes are part of the contract documentation that
is an output of Contract Administration. These requested changes serve as an input to the
Integrated Change Control process, in which they are either approved or rejected.
Payment requests are one of the organizational process asset updates that are an
output of Contract Administration. During the project execution phase as the deliverables
are delivered the buyer, they are examined for correctness and adherence to specified
standards. After the deliverables are accepted, the seller submits invoices to be paid by
the buyer. The buyer initiates the payment disbursement to the seller, and in the process
generates payment requests.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">project scope statement</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">quality metrics</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Quality metrics are an output of the Quality Planning process and an input to the
Perform Quality Control process. Quality metrics are operational definitions used to
define specifically how something is measured in the Perform Quality Control process. For
instance, in a software development project, you may track the process quality by
measuring the number of trouble reports opened during the reporting period. The
Perform Quality Assurance and Perform Quality Control processes would use this
operational definition as inputs for quality audits and inspection, respectively.
The quality policy is not an output of the Quality Planning process and an input to the
Perform Quality Control process. The quality policy is an expression of the top
management's intentions on the overall directions with respect to quality in the
organization. This may include the management's view on the quality philosophy to be
adopted by the organization. For instance, an organization adopting the Deming
philosophy would define quality as conformance to specifications. However, an
organization following the Juran philosophy would treat quality as
fitness for use. The quality policy is an important input to the Quality Planning process.
The project scope statement is not an output of the Quality Planning process and an
input to the Perform Quality Control process. The project scope statement is an output of
the Scope Definition process. It documents the project deliverables and is an important
input to the Quality Planning process.
The product description is not an output of the Quality Planning process and an input
to the Perform Quality Control process. The product description may be included in the
scope statement, and contains important technical details required as an input to Quality

		<text>You are managing three projects, Project A, Project B, and Project C, in your organization
simultaneously. A variance analysis during the projects tells you the SV for Project A is
positive, the SPI for Project B is less than 1, and the SV for Project C is negative. On which
of these projects would you take corrective action to control the project schedules?

			<answer is_right="false">Project A and Project B</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">Project B only</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">Project B and Project C</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>You would take corrective action for Project B and Project C. Variance analysis is an
effective tool to monitor and control project schedules. Schedule Variance (SV) is equal to
Earned Value (EV) less Planned Value (PV), or EV - PV. If SV is negative, it indicates that
the project is slipping behind schedule. It means that work performed to date is less than
the planned or targeted work. Conversely, a positive SV indicates that project
performance is ahead of schedule. Another key indicator of project schedule performance
is Schedule Performance Index (SPI). This is equal to EV divided by PV. If SPI is greater
than one, it indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, and if SPI is less than one then
the project is slipping behind schedule. In this scenario, Project B has an SPI of less than
one, which indicates that the project is behind schedule. In this scenario, Project C has an
SV that is negative, which indicates that the project is behind schedule. Therefore, in this
scenario, corrective action to control the project schedules would be required for Project
B and Project C.
All of the other options are incorrect because you would not need to take corrective
action on Project A or only Project B. In this scenario, Project A has a positive SV, which
indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.</explain>

		</answers>
		<explain>If you expect that future variances would not be similar to the current variances, the
Estimate at Completion (EAC) would be calculated as (AC + BAC - EV) or
(72000 + 100000 - 68000), which equals $104,000.
If you expect future variances to be similar to the current variance, you would calculate
EAC by dividing the Budget at Completion (BAC) by the present Cost Performance Index
(CPI). In this scenario, the CPI is EV / AC or 68000 / 72000, which equals 0.95. EAC is
100000 / 0.95, which equals $105,882.
If you expect that the original assumptions made during the planning phase were
incorrect, then you would need a new estimate for the remaining work to calculate the
EAC. This new estimate is the Estimate to Complete (ETC).</explain>

process is in control. It shows if differences in results are due to random causes or
unusual events that need to be identified and rectified.
A Pareto diagram is also a tool used in the Perform Quality Control process. A Pareto
diagram uses a bar chart to show project problems ranked in descending order of
significance and identifies the most significant causes that must be rectified first.
A scatter diagram is also a tool used for trend analysis in the Perform Quality Control
process. This diagram plots data on an X/Y axis to identify the correlation between them.
It helps in forecasting future trends.</explain>

		<text>You are assigned to manage an existing project. The project is in the middle of execution,
and you need to understand who has approval authority for revisions in scope. Which
document provides this information?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">project charter</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">organization chart</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">scope management plan</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">resource assignment matrix</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>The scope management plan provides information about the approval authority for
revisions in scope. It describes how to manage changes to the scope, and lists the
approval authorities for revision in scope.
The project charter does not provide information about the approval authority for
revisions in scope. The project charter is a document, issued by senior management,
which formally authorizes the existence of a project. It provides the project manager with
the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
An organization chart does not provide information about the approval authority for
revisions in scope. An organization chart is a graphical display of project reporting
relationships.
A resource assignment matrix does not provide information about the approval
authority for revisions in scope. A resource assignment matrix links the project
organization structure to the work breakdown structure to help ensure that each element
of the project's scope of work is assigned to a responsible individual.</explain>

		<text>You are the project manager of a project with many cost heads. You find it difficult to
estimate the project costs because neither you nor your organization has ever
undertaken a similar project, nor have you ever managed a similar project before. You
complete a project performance review and realize that there has been a cost variance.
You conduct a cause-and-effect analysis with the entire project team to determine the
root cause of the cost variance. What should you do FIRST?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">plan for corrective action</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">determine if the variance requires corrective action</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">modify the cost baseline to reflect the anticipated total cost at project completion</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">update the lessons learned database with the results of the cause-and-effect

analysis</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>You should first determine if the variance requires corrective action. An important part
of Cost Control is to determine whether the variance requires corrective action.
Sometimes, the variance might not be significant enough to require corrective action, or
the corrective action may not be justified.
You should not plan for corrective action. After you confirm that the variance requires
corrective action, you can plan for corrective action.
You should not modify the cost baseline to reflect the anticipated total cost at project
completion. Modifying the cost baseline to reflect the anticipated total cost at project
completion might be necessary only after confirming that the variance is significant
enough to require corrective action.
You should not update the lessons learned database with the results of the causeand-effect analysis. The causeand-effect analysis is worth the effort only if the variance is
significant. Therefore, you check if the variance is significant. If so, the cause-and-effect
analysis is done and subsequently, the lessons learned database should be updated with
the results of the cause-and-effect analysis.</explain>

		<text>Your customer has demanded changes to the product specification, which will add three
weeks to the critical path. Which action should you, as a project manager, take?</text>
		<answers>
			<answer is_right="false">refuse to make the changes</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">recover the three weeks in the project by crashing</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">recover the three weeks in the project by fast tracking</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">discuss the impact of the change with your customer</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>You need to discuss the impact of the change with your customer. Discussing the
impact of the required changes is important before any changes are incorporated.
You do not need to refuse to make the changes. You need to analyze the impact of the
change and discuss the impact of the change with the customer or management.
You do not need to recover the three weeks in the project by crashing. Crashing is a
technique used for duration compression in Schedule Development. Before using any
such technique, the impact of the changes should be discussed.
You do not need to recover the three weeks in the project by fast tracking. Fast
tracking is a technique used for duration compression in Schedule Development. Before
using any such technique, the impact of the changes should be discussed.</explain>

			<answer is_right="false">start spending time on system testing</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">initiate more reviews, namely walk-throughs and inspections</answer>
			<answer is_right="true">perform a root-cause analysis of the defects and try to prevent them from occurring
again</answer>
			<answer is_right="false">attach the number of defects reported to the performance appraisal form of the
appropriate developers</answer>
		</answers>
		<explain>Your first step should be to perform a root-cause analysis of the defects and try to
prevent them from occurring again. Doing this will address the customer's concerns as
well as help you prevent these defects in the future.
Spending time on system testing will help in identifying the defects, but it does not
ensure reduction in the number of defects.
Initiating more reviews and inspections will help you identify these defects faster.
However, these will not help in reducing the number of defects identified.
Attaching the number of defects reported to the performance appraisal form of the
appropriate developer will not help reduce the number of defects identified in the
product. The customer will remain unhappy.</explain>
